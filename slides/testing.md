# Testing

---

## üß™ What is pytest?
pytest is a powerful Python testing tool used to write simple and scalable test cases.

## Installation
With pip
```
pip install pytest pytest-cov
```
with uv
```
uv add pytest pytest-cov
```
---
# Create code to test
We will create a calculator app in `calculator.py`
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return a / b
```
---
## Set up tests
We will set up the testing folder `tests` and put the calculator test here `tests/test_calculator.py`
```python
from app.calculator import add, divide

def test_add():
    assert add(3, 4) == 7
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

def test_divide():
    assert divide(10, 2) == 5

def test_divide_by_zero():
    import pytest
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        divide(1, 0)
```
you can run all the tests by running the command
- `pytest` 
- you can drill down to the specific test `pytest tests/test_calculator.py::test_add`

- To run an specific test function`pytest -k "test_add"`
---
# Fixtures
A fixture in pytest is a reusable piece of setup code that provides data, resources, or configuration for tests. It helps you avoid repeating setup logic and makes your tests cleaner and more modular.

- `@pytest.fixture` marks a function as a fixture.

- It can be automatically injected into tests that request it by name.
---
##  Using conftest.py for Fixtures
We will make a file called `tests/conftest.py`
```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def numbers():
    return (6, 3)
```
Use this fixture in your test:

```python
def test_add_with_fixture(numbers):
    from app.calculator import add
    a, b = numbers
    assert add(a, b) == 9
```
---
## Coverage
üìä What is Coverage in Testing?
- Coverage (short for code coverage) is a metric that measures how much of your source code is executed when you run your tests.

‚úÖ Why It's Useful
- Identifies untested code (e.g., functions or branches that never run in tests)

- Helps ensure important logic paths are tested

- Encourages writing more comprehensive test suites

üîç Common Types of Coverage
- Line coverage	Are all lines of code executed?
- Branch coverage	Are all if/else, try/except branches taken?
- Function coverage	Are all functions or methods called?
---
## üõ† Example (using pytest-cov)
`pytest --cov=your_module tests/`
Gives you output like:
```
Name              Stmts   Miss  Cover
-------------------------------------
your_module.py       20      2    90%
```

This means 18 out of 20 lines were executed during the test run ‚Äî 90% coverage.

---
# Calculator example
`pytest --cov=app tests/`

*Optional*

- Make a pytest.ini file
```
[pytest]
addopts = --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```
then just run `pytest`
